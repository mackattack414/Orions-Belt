Letter of Intent
===================



This document is meant to better explain and make clear my intentions with this project, so that anyone reading it may understand and choose the way it may or may not participate. Should you have any doubt or concern about it, feel free to ask me on the relevant thread in  [HashTalk’s](https://hashtalk.org/topic/23234/ann-orion-belt-community-base-camp) or by email at [orion.belt.community@gmail.com](orion.belt.community@gmail.com)

>**Disclaimer:** *Orion Controller&trade;, Prime Controller&trade; and Paycoin&trade; are trademarks or otherwise property of GAW Miners; understand that GAW Miners is not affiliated, associated or related to this project in any way other than being mentioned*

## **Orion Belt what?**
**I know it may sound presumptuous on my part, but every name choice has a reasoning,  so I would like you to know this one’s ☺**

For starters, know that Josh and GAW’s rational was around Optimus Prime (from Transformers&trade;) and how it was called before that, Orion. But I know that we have to maintain away from copyrighted materials, either GAW’s or anyone else’s and the Orion constellation is, for all intents and purposes, public domain.

The Paycoin&trade; network is built around of a central core, where Prime Controllers&trade; tender to the high level functions and overall routing of the network, followed by a stream of nodes, the Orion Controllers&trade;, from where Prime Controllers&trade; can emerge, that act as the second layer in providing network resilience and services, as well as having the entire blockchain available.

This layer must be comprised of millions of nodes to sustain a healthy and truly decentralized network for Paycoin&trade; and give rise to as many Prime Controllers&trade; as the network needs.

Hence, what better analogy than that of a star constellation with millions of stars, with its nebula being the birthplace of new stars? And what stands at the middle of such constellation, being the most widely recognized way of find the constellation?
The belt!

That’s why the project has its name – it’s aligned with its goal, under that analogy for the Paycoin&trade; network.

## **Goals & Rules**

**The goal is to spark the existence of a worldwide community dedicated to the**
**creation and maintenance of a healthy network of Orion nodes in the Paycoin&trade;  network**

Such community will be a reference point for those seeking knowledge in how to
build and maintain an Orion node, providing both recordkeeping and access to
knowledge about Orion Controllers&trade;, as well as support in any other form that its
member’s deem fit.

It will be open to anyone whom cares to join and will be, for the most part, self- regulated. I will be just one more member.

It will be supported by all its member’s in either way they so choose, without any
specific obligation or method.

The community’s main support and asset will be a website, described further in this document, that I’ll be running and associate with the Internet domain
orionbelt.net

The project will uphold each member’s take on its anonymity status and choices, but it may also bring about things that cannot be dealt with that way.

## **My pledge**

**The internet is filled with anonymity anonymity –it is part of its core and an important factor it is part of its core and an important factor on why it has become what it is.**

The blockchain has brought us a technology piece that allows for transparent and
trustless transitions, whilst maintaining a neutral position on being anonymous.

Whenever the project or its support involves money – pay or being paid for something – it will support itself on blockchained technologies, so it can stay trustless in this concern.

Nevertheless, humans still need to trust each other for all the rest, and so there are a lot of things that cannot happen within the veil of anonymity.

**When dropping that anonymity is either morally or lawfully imperative, be sure I’ll take the step of first revealing myself, if I haven’t done it by then.** 

##**Website Story**

**As its main asset, the website will provide the means to create, uphold and maintain the community’s collective resources.**

The content of the website will be considered a property of the community and as such, in the unlikely event that it ceases to exist, every member will be entitled to a full copy of its contents at the time.

However, please bear this in mind at all times: it’s not a democracy, I will own the domain and if I feel the direction taken no longer relates to the initial goal and spirit or an otherwise later revision that I agree with, the website will no longer be associated with it.

>It will be comprised of three main areas:

- **The standard website info and content**, such as contacts, disclaimers and brief info on the content – public anonymous access

- **The Public Knowledge Base on Orion Controllers** that the community feeds and maintains – public anonymous access for reading and consulting.

- **The Community support**, where the internal, member-only stuff happens, including the tendering of the Knowledge Base – members only.

>Within the members-only part of the website, the following is available:

- **The Knowledge Base** – a wiki-based site, curated and edited by the members, with pretty much what you can expect of such, including the revision and official community sanction on what content goes public, as well as the process of all the content management implied.

- **The forum The forum** – yes, of course, we’ll need a forum, can’t be only on HT forever☺; it will have avatars, profiles, following, mods, lots of threads and even trolls.


- **The Status Page** – a dynamic list of the community’s nodes, their ID and Operator, their health status and whatever we see fit. All information will be given voluntarily by the owners of the nodes, no obligations.

- **The Services Page** – where it will all unfolds; this part will support the higher functions of the community: that of creating and maintaining a method through which the members are able to have a stake and manage that participation on the community’s Orion nodes (or even Prime Controllers&trade;, if we get there)

##**Cash?**

**This can’t be done with magic, there’s money involved, of course. But it’s mine☺**

This project is going to be supported by me, because I want to see it becoming a reality. The costs associated with having the domain and the website up are mine to take care off.

That being said, you will all be able to participate in a lot of ways, even with cash if you so want – but you’ll have to do it directly, i.e., **I will not be taking donations be taking donations or any form of monetary contributions.**

I will, however, take any other form of help you’ll be willing to give. And that’s why I’m not worried about those costs. The heavy part will be done, hopefully, by all the member’s willingness to help and do work in benefit of themselves and the rest of the community members.

Also, there’s probably going to be a lot more resources needed to keep this going, as it grows, so every member will have the chance of taking care of other expenses that might come up, if they so wish.

 **The existence of any other form of monetary-supported activity supported activity taken upon by the community will be sorted out and voted within the community itself.**

##**Fine, but when?**

**The initial stated dates are still valid: phase 1 of the project, i.e., having the website up and as functional as possible, up to the 19th January 2015**; the more advanced features will stay tentatively scheduled to before the end of the first round for Prime Controllers&trade;, but the community’s efforts will truly dictate that after it’s up and running.

**That being said, there’s a survey that prospect members are humbly s are humbly welcomed to answer, up until the 11th December, that will be paramount on getting this started as early as possible – as early as possible☺**

The survey responses will be taken into analysis by me from the 12th through 15th December – we’ll all have a lot more to keep us wake by then, when Paybase&trade;, Prime Controllers&trade; and Paycoin&trade; actually launch.

By then we’ll also have all the necessary details on Orion Controllers&trade; too, maybe some of us will even have already started one up ☺

**With that new information, I will call upon everyone and ask every member to take a role, around the 20th December, so you can all have your holidays completely ruined if Paycoin&trade; hasn’t done that by itself ☺**

##**Can’t wait that long!**

**Well, I won’t stand in anybody’s way. I have no delusions of grandeur, this is not a race for me.**
I do not intent this to be the first and only website with this purpose, nor the only community around. I do not intent on be the first to run Orion nodes, or to be the best, or to control anything for anyone. Even less to have any sort of advantage over others with the same goals.

All I want is this to come to fruition and be solid, enjoyable, helpful and professional in nature – I will not risk it becoming a botched up job!

**If you like the idea but you’re not up for the waiting, please, be my guest and make it come true (with another name, of course).** *I will consider it to be a compliment and will feel flattered by it.probably join it myself* ☺

##**Ok, enough with the talk! What now?**

This document is complemented by one other, with more technical and [geeky stuff](https://github.com/mackattack414/Orions-Belt/blob/master/Geek%20Stuff.md), be sure to look it up if you’re interested, it will be posted in the thread also.

**Please go back to the  [thread on HT](https://hashtalk.org/topic/23234/ann-orion-belt-community-base-camp) and follow the link on the survey! or click [here](https://qtrial2011.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_81gxvH1x8VW0gsZ) I need your feedback on all of this!**
